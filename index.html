<h2>Student-Athlete at The University of Maine</h2>

<p>
    Hi everyone, my name is Kelly Fogarty and I am a student at the University of Maine. I am enrolled in the Maine Business School, however I have not declared what part of business I will be focusing on. I would like to share with you a little bit about my life, and what is important to me. In the links below I have provided you with information about my hometown, my hobbies, my family, and finally my favorite "things" in life. I hope you enjoy my website!
